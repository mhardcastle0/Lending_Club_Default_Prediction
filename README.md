# Predicting Personal Loan Defaults

### Summary

Predicting whether a borrower will repay is of primary concern for lending companies. There are several macroeconomic factors that might influence a borrowers ability to repay his or her loan - a contracting economy, all else equal, will typically expose lenders to greater risk, as borrowers are more likely to lose jobs or assets and to be unable to repay their loans. This project evaluates whether incorporating widely-available macroeconomic features into models can improve predictions of the likelihood that a borrower will default on his or her loan obligation.

### Contents

This project was completed in stages using Jupyter notebooks to complete each step. The files are as follows:
<ol>
  <li><b>data_wrangling.ipynb</b> - The notebook wherein the collected data is manipulated to make it usable for data exploration and machine learning.</li>
  <li><b>data_storytelling.ipynb</b> - An exploration of the data and graphical analysis of some of the selected macroeconomic features.</li>
  <li><b>inferential_statistics.ipynb</b> - A more rigorous exploration of the monthly macroeconomic features as they relate to the outcome variable of interest, the likelihood of default in each month.</li>
  <li><b>machine_learning.ipynb</b> - An evaluation of whether defaults could be predicted accuratel using three different machine learning models.</li>
  <li><b>final_presentation.pdf</b> - A slide deck summarizing the process and the findings.</li>
  <li><b>Final Writeup.pdf</b> - A detailed report on each step of the process, from data wrangling to conclusions.</li>
